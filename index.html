			Here is the truth, there are people out there myself included that dont think anyone is a gamer unless they are "core". I would never in a thousand years waste my time playing a single player game as a core gamer. People that play single player games, are not really gamers to us core gamers... they are tourists. We core gamers spend hrs looking up configs, exploits and load outs, playing at low settings on 144+ hz monitors with 1000hz polling rate mice, we are extremely competitive. The definition of casual gaming to a core game is: playing single player games on ultra settings. a casual gamer plays for the escape, not the destruction of others. and to us, a casual gamer is not a gamer. CS toxic players are not more toxic to women than other players, it might be that you are sensitive. if you can be trolled to the point you are not having a good time, you need to turn within. harden up. Some people are more sensitive than others, maybe stay single player.. keep in mind to some of us 2 hrs a day is not gaming, its warming up.
